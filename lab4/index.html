			<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and problem solving</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We had some trouble thinking of how we wanted to organize the high-level tasks to our hang-man game. We also had some trouble figuring out how to place the precode. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Over all this lab went really well, we were able to use our previous knowledge from other labs as a reference to any small questions we had. We were also able to get a majority of this lab done in our section! </p>
